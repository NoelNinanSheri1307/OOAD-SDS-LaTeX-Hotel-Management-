\section{System Architecture}

The Hotel Management System follows a three-tier architecture comprising the Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Layer. This architecture ensures separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Presentation Layer:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Provides the graphical user interface for users (guests, staff, admin).
        \item Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for responsiveness.
        \item Communicates with the business logic layer through HTTP requests.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Business Logic Layer:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Acts as the bridge between the presentation and data layers.
        \item Developed using PHP (or Node.js/Java/Python as alternatives based on deployment).
        \item Handles room allocation logic, booking flow, payment processing, authentication, etc.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Layer:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consists of a MySQL relational database.
        \item Stores persistent data like user information, room details, bookings, and transactions.
        \item Enforces constraints and maintains referential integrity.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The system uses RESTful APIs for communication between client and server. The architecture supports role-based access control to ensure secure and restricted operations. Optional integration with third-party payment gateways (like Razorpay or PayPal) is also supported.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\textbf{Technology Stack:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Frontend:} HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
    \item \textbf{Backend:} PHP (or optionally Node.js/Java/Python)
    \item \textbf{Database:} MySQL
    \item \textbf{Web Server:} Apache or Nginx
\end{itemize}

The architecture diagram below illustrates the layered structure of the Hotel Management System. The system is built using a five-layer model, with each layer having a specific responsibility:

- The **User Interface Layer** consists of components that users interact with, like the Guest and Admin interfaces.
- The **Application Layer** contains modules such as Booking and Feedback, which handle specific user interactions.
- The **Business Logic Layer** performs validation and enforces business rules through dedicated components.
- The **Data Access Layer** serves as a bridge to interact with the database.
- Finally, the **Database Layer** stores all persistent data using MySQL.

This modular design improves scalability, maintainability, and separation of concerns across different parts of the system.

\section{Data Design}
The Hotel Management System uses a relational database model to efficiently manage and store data. The core tables and their primary functions are described below:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Users Table:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stores information about all system users (Admins, Receptionists, Housekeeping Staff, Guests).
        \item Key fields: UserID (Primary Key), Name, Email, Password, Role, Phone.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Rooms Table:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Stores room details including status, type, and pricing.
        \item Key fields: RoomID (Primary Key), RoomType, PricePerNight, Status (Available/Occupied/Maintenance).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Bookings Table:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Records all room booking transactions.
        \item Key fields: BookingID (Primary Key), UserID (Foreign Key), RoomID (Foreign Key), CheckInDate, CheckOutDate, TotalAmount, PaymentStatus.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Payments Table:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tracks payments for room bookings.
        \item Key fields: PaymentID (Primary Key), BookingID (Foreign Key), PaymentMethod, AmountPaid, PaymentDate.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Housekeeping Table:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Manages housekeeping schedules and records.
        \item Key fields: TaskID (Primary Key), RoomID (Foreign Key), StaffID (Foreign Key from Users), TaskDate, TaskStatus.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The database design ensures data normalization and referential integrity through the use of primary and foreign keys. Indexing is applied on frequently queried columns for performance optimization.

In addition to the core database schema, the system ensures referential integrity through foreign key constraints and indexes for efficient data access. Data normalization has been considered to reduce redundancy and maintain consistency. Backup strategies and data recovery plans are also in place to safeguard against data loss or corruption.

\section{Functional Requirements Matrix}
The Requirements Matrix provides a structured mapping between the system's functional and non-functional requirements and the components or modules that implement them. This traceability ensures that each requirement is addressed by specific design elements and serves as a checkpoint for validating the completeness of the software design. 

By linking requirements to implementation modules such as Booking, Room Management, Payment, and User Authentication, the matrix enhances transparency and accountability throughout the development process. Additionally, it facilitates better project management and testing, enabling the team to verify that all client expectations are met during software validation.

\subsection*{Functional Requirements Description}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FR1: User Login and Authentication} \\
    Enables users (guests, staff, admin) to securely log in to the system using valid credentials. Credentials are verified against stored records in the database.

    \item \textbf{FR2: Guest Registration and Profile Management} \\
    Allows new guests to register by providing necessary personal details. Also enables guests to manage and update their profiles post-registration.

    \item \textbf{FR3: Room Search and Availability Check} \\
